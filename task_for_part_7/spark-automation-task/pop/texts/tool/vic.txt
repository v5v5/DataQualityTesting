Eye on the TV
'Cause tragedy thrills me.
Whatever flavour
It happens to be like:
"Killed by the husband",
"Drowned by the ocean",
"Shot by his own son",
"She used a poison in his tea",
"And kissed him goodbye".
That's my kind of story.
It's no fun 'til someone dies.

Don't look at me like
I am a monster.
Frown out your one face
But with the other.
Stare like a junkie
Into the TV.
Stare like a zombie
While the mother
Holds her child,
Watches him die
Hands to the sky,
Crying, "Why, oh, why?"

'Cause I need to watch things die from a distance.
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.

You all need it too.
Don't lie.

Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?

We won't give pause until the blood is flowing.
Neither the brave nor bold
Will write us the story, so,
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing.

I need to watch things die from a good safe distance.
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.

You all feel the same.
So, why can't we just admit it?

Blood like rain come down.
Drum on grave and ground.

Part vampire, part warrior.
Carnivore and voyeur.
Stare at the transmittal.
Sing to the death rattle.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie.

Credulous at best, your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of men.
Pull your head on out your hippie haze and give a listen.
Shouldn't have to say it all again.

The universe is hostile, so impersonal.
Devour to survive.
So it is. So it's always been.

We all feed on tragedy.
It's like blood to a vampire.

Vicariously I live while the whole world dies.
Much better you than I.
