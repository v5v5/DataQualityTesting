Damn I love the Jag, the jet and the mansion
Oh yea
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands
Oh yea
It’s good to live expensive you know it but
My knees get weak, intensive
When you give me k-kisses
That’s money honey
When I’m your lover and your mistress
That’s money honey
When you touch me it’s so delicious
That’s money honey
Baby when you tear me to pieces
That’s money honey
That’s M-O-N-E-Y, so sexy, I That’s money honey
Damn I’d love a boat by the beach on the west coast
Oh yea
And I’d enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
Oh yea
Its good to live expensive you know it but
My knees get weak, intensive
You know I appreciate the finer things
But it’s not what makes me happiest baby
Your tender loving’s more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle baby, baby
